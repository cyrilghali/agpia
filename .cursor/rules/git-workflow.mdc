# Git Workflow

## Branch Protection

`main` is protected. Direct pushes are blocked.

- Always create a feature branch and open a PR to merge into `main`.
- Never force-push to `main`.
- PRs cannot be merged until the Vercel deployment succeeds.

## Commits

- Keep commit messages short, lowercase, in English (e.g. `fix build`, `add arabic`, `store language pref`).
- One logical change per commit.

## Branching

- Branch from `main`, name branches descriptively: `fix/scroll-bug`, `feat/add-coptic-font`, `content/update-vespers-ar`.
- Delete branches after merge.
