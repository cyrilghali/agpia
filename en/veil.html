<div class="psalm-verse">
                    Against You only I have sinned, and done evil before You: that You might be just in Your sayings, and might overcome when You are judged. For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins my mother conceived me.

<div class="psalm-verse">
                    For, behold, You have loved the truth: You have manifested to me the hidden and unrevealed things of Your wisdom.

        When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take Him by force, to make Him a king, He departed again into a mountain Himself alone. And when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, and entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them. And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the ship: and they were afraid. But He said to them, It is I; do not be afraid. Then they willingly received Him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land where they were going.
