                    Holy Father, who wishes the repentance of sinners, promising to accept them back; look, O Lord, at this moment, at a sinful soul who had erred and lost her way in the valleys of transgressions for many years, and wherein she was embittered and wretched for being removed from the fountain of her salvation.

                    Yet now she comes forth to Thee, asking to be cleansed from all defilement and filth that sullied her.

                    O Lord, I am not worthy that Thou should come under the roof of my house, for I am sinful, but say Thou first a word and my soul shall be healed. Say unto my soul: "Your sins are forgiven." I am barren and wanting all righteousness, and have but Thy compassion, mercy and Love-of-Man. And Thou hast condescended from the heaven of Thine ineffable glory to our afflictions and accepted to be born in a manger.

                    Let my communion be for partaking with Thee and for effacing all defilement, the mortification of my lusts, the doing of Thy Life-giving commandments, the healing of my soul and body from all sins, the acceptance of Thy gifts, the endwelling of Thy grace, the descent of Thy spirit for union with and abiding in Thee, that I may live for the glory of Thy Holy Name.
