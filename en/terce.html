                    I sought the Lord diligently, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my fear. Draw near to Him, and be enlightened: and your faces shall not be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and delivered him out of all his afflictions. The angel of the Lord will encamp round about those who fear Him, and will deliver them. Taste and see that the Lord is sweet: blessed is the man who hopes in Him. Fear the Lord, all you His saints: for there is no want to those who fear Him. The rich have become poor and they hungered: but those who seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.

Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking guile. Turn away from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are bent to their prayer: but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to wipe out their memorial from upon the earth.

The Lord is near to those who are contrite in their heart; and will save the lowly in spirit. Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but out of them all the Lord will deliver them. The Lord will keep all their bones: not one of them shall be broken. The death of the sinners is evil: and those who hate righteousness will grieve. The Lord will save the souls of His servants: and none of those who hope in Him shall grieve. <span class="alleluia">ALLELUIA.</span>

                    Have mercy on us, O God, and have mercy on us, who, at all times and in every hour, in heaven and on earth, is worshipped and glorified, Christ our God, the good, the long suffering, the abundant in mercy, and the great in compassion, who loves the righteous and has mercy on the sinners of whom I am chief; who does not wish the death of the sinner but rather that he returns and lives, who calls all to salvation for the promise of the blessings to come.
                </div>
<div class="prayer-text">
                    Lord receive from us our prayers in this hour and in every hour. Ease our life and guide us to fulfill Your commandments. Sanctify our spirits. Cleanse our bodies. Conduct our thoughts. Purify our intentions. Heal our diseases. Forgive our sins. Deliver us from every evil grief and distress of heart. Surround us by Your holy angels, that, by their camp, we may be guarded and guided, and attain the unity of faith, and the knowledge of Your imperceptible and infinite glory. For You are blessed forever. Amen.
