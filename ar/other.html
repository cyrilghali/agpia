                    Give Your blessing for the fruits of the earth, for favorable winds, and for the growth of trees. Raise the waters of the rivers. Bless the dews and the rains. Give sufficiency to those who are in need. Allow debtors to pay their debts.

<div class="prayer-text">
                    Gather the dispersion of those who are separated. Accept the repentance of those who repent, and the confession of those who confess. Give understanding to the comforted. Render judgment, Lord, to those who commit injustice.

<div class="prayer-text">
                    Fill our hearts with joy, gladness, comfort and exultation, so that, supplied with what is necessary in all things, we may abound in every good work that is pleasing to You.

                    Bless, Lord, the crops with heavenly graces. In Your goodness, bless the crown of this year. Bless, Lord, the sower, the cultivator, the planter and the reaper, as You blessed the crops of the sixth year for the children of Israel.

<div class="prayer-text">
                    Bless, Lord, this our assembly and all the assemblies of the Orthodox peoples. Preserve for us the life and ministry of our father the Patriarch, our high priest. Save him, Lord, and save his people from all evil, all temptation and all affliction. Keep also his companions in the apostolic ministry: our fathers the metropolitans, our fathers the bishops, our fathers the abbots and our fathers the priests, our brothers the deacons, our fathers the monks and our brothers the lay people, as well as all those who have come here to participate in this prayer and in all Orthodox prayers imploring the forgiveness of their sins and mercy for their souls.
                </div>
<div class="prayer-text">
                    Bless us and bless them, absolve us and absolve them, forgive our sins as well as theirs, those past or to come, committed by ourselves or not, during the night or during the day, manifest or hidden.
                </div>
<div class="prayer-text">
                    Grant, Lord, that the places of assembly, the holy churches, the Orthodox monasteries, the elders who dwell therein, their deacons, their directors and those who dwell in them may endure. May hope, peace, love-agape and trusting obedience reside with them. Humble the evil enemy at our feet and at theirs. Leave him not a single share in us or in them, to strike from the right or from the left. Protect them by Your exalted hand and Your powerful arm. Save us, my Master, from evil temptations and from snares set, visible or invisible.
                </div>
<div class="prayer-text">
                    Remember, Lord, our fathers and our mothers, our brothers and our sisters, our families and our relatives, those who teach us, our spiritual and bodily children and all the children of baptism. Remember, Lord, those who have labored with us in communion. Remember, Lord, those who have given us to eat and to drink from the fruit of their toils and their labors, those who have lodged us in their residences and helped us. Repay them, Lord, with things that last instead of things that pass, with heavenly things instead of earthly things. Fill their houses and their storerooms with every grace. Render unto them, Lord, render unto them thirty, sixty or a hundred for one, with the forgiveness of their sins, in the Kingdom of heaven.
                </div>
<div class="prayer-text">
                    Remember, Lord, those who have done us good, us as well as our brothers the poor, by every blessing of beneficence, for the sake of Your holy Name. Bless them. Remember, Lord, those who occupy themselves with the sacrifices, the offerings, the wine, the oil, the firstfruits, the incense, the veils, the gifts, the books of reading, and all the vessels of the altar. Repay them, Lord, for their gifts, by the forgiveness of their sins. Establish them in this age with a joyful life, and in the age to come with eternal life.

<div class="prayer-text">
                    Remember, Lord, our fathers and brothers who have preceded us in sleep and have departed for Rest in the Orthodox Faith in Christ. Lord, grant rest to their souls in the bosom of our holy fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, in the land of the living, the Paradise of joy.

<div class="prayer-text">
                    As for us, who are still alive, help us to obtain the salvation of our souls and direct our lives according to Your good will. Deign, Lord, to remember my weakness, my humility and my insignificance, I a sinful laborer, who am unworthy to stand before Your hands. Do not reject me because of my many sins and my defilements.
                </div>
<div class="prayer-text">
                    Raise up, O Lord, the horn of salvation of Your people by the sign of Your life-giving cross. Give, Lord, Your deliverance in distress, Your help in affliction and humiliation. Save us, Lord, and save all those who are in distress, and heal the sick of Your people.
                </div>
<div class="prayer-text">
                    And cause Your Christian people, Lord, those who are present with us and those who are absent, to be blessed and absolved by Your divine mouth, from the east to the west, and from the left to the right. Accept us as You accepted the thief on Your right hand on the wood of the Cross, and granted him the Paradise of joy.
                </div>
<div class="prayer-text">
                    Remember, Lord, the orphans and the widows, the excommunicated, the sick and those who have no one to remember them. Remember them and us in the heavenly Jerusalem.

<div class="prayer-text">
                    Remember, Lord, those who rise, and those who are disabled, those who are in suffering, those who have had accidents while traveling on land, at sea, in steep places, valleys, roads, on the peaks of mountains, on hills or in caves. Remember also those who are in dungeons or prisons, the exiled, the expatriated, those who are bound or chained because of the chains of authorities and of demons. Bring them and lead them all to port safe and sound, victorious, in one piece, and with profit, for their soul, their body and their spirit.

                    My Lord Jesus Christ, grant that this prayer be accepted before You and that it be without hypocrisy, without pride, without arrogance, without presumption and without shame. Help us, O God, to do what pleases You. Help us to act according to Your commandments. Help us with the drunkenness of death, with what precedes it and what follows it, for You are a God who is good, patient, full of mercy and compassion.
                </div>
<div class="prayer-text">
                    O God, keep the door of Your Church open to us as in the ages and times past, and until the end of all times.

                    Have mercy on us, O God, according to Your great mercy, through the intercessions of the Pearl of purity and blessings, full of honor, our Lady of all, the pride of our race, the Virgin of pure virginity, Mary, and of the honored martyr Mark the Evangelist, the apostle who preached in the land of Egypt, of all the angels, of our fathers the prophets, the apostles, the martyrs, the saints, the ascetics, the champions and the athletes, and of all those who pleased the Lord in their good works from Adam until the end of the ages.
